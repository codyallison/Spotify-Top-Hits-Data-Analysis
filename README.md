Hello, 

This repository includes information for a group assignment for edX data analytics bootcamp in association with Washington University in Saint Louis. 

The group is composed of the following members:
Cody Allison
Hannah Weber
James Beckmeyer

To use this repository you may navigate to the file called "all_years_playlist_data.ipynb" (https://github.com/codyallison/group-project-1-DA-bootcamp/blob/main/Data/all_years_playlist_data.ipynb)
Here the jupyter notebook file will read CSV data from our research and conduct a number of statistical and graphical analysis. These analysis include anova tests to determine the statistcal significance of the data, comparison of popularity vs given spotify track attributes, and average attribute values per year.

The data itself looks to analyze the track attributes as defined by spotify and see how these trends changed over the 2010s and what impact, if any 2020s/COVID may have had on the preliminary data we have for this decade. 
For more information about the attributes we considered, see the spotify api documentation: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-several-audio-features
